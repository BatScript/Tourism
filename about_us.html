      <h1>BONJOUR</h1>
      <h2>I am Mohit</h2>
      <p>I am a web developer. Well atleast what I want to be. I have created severel websites using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javascript, jQuery, etc. Currently I am a front end web developer but I want to learn and practice the other end of website
        building. I also want to learn UI/UX designing and create mobile app designs. I love to watch movies and listen to songs. When I am bored I love to read books as well. I love to eat pizza. Whenever my friends plan to get pizza I always keep
        myself around them haha. My strength is leadership, because I have leaded about three projects in different programming languages in my class. People feel comfortable around me and they trust me that's why I lead all the group projects I am
        assigned to. My weakness is I cannot concentrate elsewhere if I have been given assignment or project, that's why I fail to be a social person, butb I have been working on this and I have felt myself improving.</p>
